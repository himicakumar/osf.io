    <h4>Registrations</h4>
    <p>Registrations are permanent, read only copies of a project. Registration saves the state of
        a project at a particular point in time&mdash;such as right before data collection, or right when a manuscript
        is submitted.</p>
    <p>To register a project, click on the button in the grey navigation bar. Click on "New Registration", select a
        meta-data template, fill it out, and then confirm the registration. The registration will at a separate,
        permanent URL that is linked to the project. Then, you can continue editing and revising the project itself.</p>
