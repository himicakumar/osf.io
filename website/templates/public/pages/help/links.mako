    <h4>Links</h4>
    <p>Links are an alternative to building a component within a project. Adding a link means that
        instead of making a new component or project inside the project, the component already exists separately and
        is only being pointed to from the present project.</p>
    <p>Any existing public project can be a link, be it your own project or someone else's. Linking is useful if
        you want to reference another persons's work or indicate that something is part of a larger
        project.</p>
    <p>A link can created be by visiting the project you want to add the link to. Click "Add Links" in the components
        section of your project dashboard and search for the project you wish to link to.</p>
