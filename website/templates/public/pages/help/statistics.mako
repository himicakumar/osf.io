    <h4>Statistics</h4>
    <p>Every project comes with a statistics page where you can view information on how often people are visiting
        your project and where they are being referred from.</p>
    <p>The information displayed on the statistics page can be changed. From the statistics page of your project
        (found by clicking "Statistics" in the grey navigation bar), click on "Widgets & Dashboard." Select the
        widget you wish to add by clicking on the orange arrow to the right of the widget's name.</P>
